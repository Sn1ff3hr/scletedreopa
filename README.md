# Website Overview

This repository contains a simple inventory and ordering demo with two pages:

- `owner.html` – allows a business owner to list inventory.
- `consumer.html` – lets customers browse items and place orders.

For details on setting up code formatting tools (ESLint and Prettier) and required Node version, see [`docs/setup.md`](docs/setup.md).
